#What can you say about the relationship now? The correlation is less positie than before, it does not seem that a good EFF score implies a higher salary. There are a lot of factors with salary caps that contribute to this not being as positive as before. More experience does not necessarily mean earn more.

#### 6: Comments and Reflections
- What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?
  1. Making the plots look nice, figuring out read_csv()
- What things were easy even though we haven't done it in class/lab?
  1. Some of the data frame manipulation
- Did you need help to complete the assignment>
  1. No.
- How much time did it take to complete this hw?
  1. A couple of hours, (3-4)
- What was the most time consuming part?
  1. The setting up of the read_csv()
- Was there anything you did not understand?
  1. No, it is all straight forward
- Was there anything frustrating in particular?
  1. A lot of the work is repetitive and tedious
- Was there anything exciting? Something you feel proud of?
  1. I'm learning R!
